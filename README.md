# Amazon-Web-Scraping-Project
In this project, we crawed through the amazon website using the beautiful soup library in python and exported our insights into a csv file. 

This repository will be updated regularly and new codes will be added from time to time.
Feel free to play around with the codes and give feedbacks. 

Shallom.
